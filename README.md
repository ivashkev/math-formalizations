# math-formalizations

by Evgeny Ivashkevich

This project is focused on the formalization of some elementary mathematical theories in Coq and is intended as a compagnion to the lecture course on math formalizations and certified programming:

1. Sort function as a demonstration of certified programming style
3. Propositional algebra and calculus, their soundness and completeness
5. Untyped lambda calculus
7. Constructive axiomatics for plane Euclidean geometry
8. Hughes algorithm for list reverse function
