by Evgeny V Ivashkevich

This project is focused on the formalization of some elementary mathematical theories in Coq and is intended as an addition to the lecture course on math formalizations and certified programming:

1. Sort function as a demonstration of certified programming style
3. Algebra and calculus of statements, their completeness and adequacy
5. Untyped lambda calculus
7. Constructive axiomatics for plane Euclidean geometry
